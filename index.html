            <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>Hi I am Afseen! I live in Austin Texas. I'm going ot Lake Travis High School next year as a 9th grader. 
              </p>

                <h3>Skills, Interests and Experience</h3>
                <p>My skills are coding, paying attention, and designing. A few of my interests are painting, playing the piano/guitar, baking, and just having fun in life. I also love music and think that its a greater way of expressing feelings then words. I've done coding in middle school for 2 years and been in a robotics club. </p>
